## TODOs:
- Fix assertions in the e2e test
- Remove `TestStateLoggerShould` from Pitest exclusions
- Update badges in README  
- Improve README
- Create a demo project
- Add timings to the LSD - diff between request and response
- Store the last successful run's traceId, so it's possible to create an automatic diff the next time the test fails
